 â€¢ Business P3.20
 A supermarket awards coupons depending on how much a customer spends on groceries. For example, if you spend $50, you will get a coupon worth eight percent of that amount. The following table shows the percent used to calculate the coupon awarded for different amounts spent. Write a program that calculates and prints the value of the coupon a person can receive based on groceries purchased.
 
 Here is a sample run:
 
 Please enter the cost of your groceries: 14
 You win a discount coupon of $ 1.12. (8% of your purchase)
 
 Money Spent                Coupon Percentage
 Less than $10              No coupon
 From $10 to $60            8%
 More than $60 to $150      10%
 More than $150 to $210     12%
 More than $210             14%
